title = "Has the introduction of point-of-sale legislation led to a reduction in exposure to tobacco retailing? A longitudinal study?"
abstract = "Greater availability of tobacco retailers in neighbourhoods has been linked with increased odds of adolescent smoking. We examined change in neighbourhood tobacco retailer density surrounding the introduction of the Point Of Sale legislation (POS: 2013 and 2015) using data from the Scottish Tobacco Retailers Register (STRR) (2012-2017). We then linked STRR data to surveys of secondary school pupils and marketing audits of retailers to further understand variability in exposure by activity space and visibility of tobacco products. Growing socioeconomic disparity in the availability and visibility of tobacco in urban communities, undermine national declines in tobacco retailing following the introduction of the POS legislation."
