title = "Quantifying exposure to the natural environment across the lifecourse: Implications for health inequalities"
abstract = "It is essential to take a life course approach to understand the determinants of health in later life. A life course approach aims to quantify physical or social exposures during gestation, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood and later life. This talk will explore the methods that are used to collect information on everyday (e.g. smartphone GPS) to lifetime movement (e.g. life-grid), and how these can be used to quantify exposure to the natural environment. The talk will conclude with a discussion on how promoting greater interaction with the natural environment can be effective for reducing health inequalities."
