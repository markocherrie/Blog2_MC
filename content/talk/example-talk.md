abstract = "The Population, Health and Place research group would like to invite you to a workshop on using R to process large data sets. R is a statistical programme for processing, analysis and graphics. While data has grown in volume, velocity and variety, so too has the need to document the steps taken in the collection and subsequent analysis. By working through a batch processing example in R, this talk aims to expose the audience to the setup, execution and enhancement of an automated workflow, with the hope that it will stimulate discussion on other potential applications."
