# Background
The Social Fragmentation Index (SFI) was developed by Peter Congdon. The indicator aims to use census variables to capture (for small areas across the country) aspects of the local population that may reflect a greater collective risk of social fragmentation/lack of social cohesion. The census variables are proxies for these risk factors, rather than 'direct' indicators. It focusses on risk due to potentially high levels of isolation and residential instability of members of the population. The earliest use of this indicator was with 1991 census data, investigating the relationship with suicide risk (Congdon, 1996). It has been used in a Scottish context (1991 census), understanding how it co-varies with deprivation and urbanicity, and associates with pychoses admissions (Allardyce et al., 2005). The SFI shows some association with socioeconomic deprivation but also varies independently. It has been shown, after controlling for other socio-economic risk factors, to be associated with various health outcomes including use of care for mental illness (Curtis et al., 2006). The index is built from four census variables: 

* Number of unmarried persons
* Single-person households
* Number of privately rented households
* Mobility in the previous year

The aim of this work was to generate SFI estimates for datazones in Scotland. We also aimed to explore the association with socio-economic deprivation.  

# Method

## Data
The 2011 census data was downloaded from the [Scotland Census website](http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/data-warehouse.html), at 2001 datazone geography. Three of the indicators reside in the 'Bulk tables' files:

* Number of unmarried persons - KS103SC.csv
* Single-person households- KS104SC.csv
* Number of privately rented households - KS402SC.csv

The final table can be downloaded from the 'Additional and Commissioned Tables' section:

* Mobility in the previous year - CT_0210_2011.csv

## Data Manipulation

The full code for the data manipulation is presented in supplementary material (S1). 

Each CSV file was read into R and a series of generic cleaning procedures were performed (some extra formatting was required for the moves in the last year indicator):

* Take out Scotland row
* Rename of datazone column to "Datazone2001"
* Took out commas or hypens in variables representing the number of people in the datazone
* Converted variables to numeric

Each indicator was derived in the following way:

* For the unmarried indicator we subtracted  all people aged 16 and over from those that were recorded as married.
* For the living alone indicator, we added together the number of people who were in the not living in a couple category, which included: single (never married or never registered a same-sex civil partnership), Married or in a registered same-sex civil partnership, Separated (but still legally married or still legally in a same-sex civil partnership, divorced or formerly in a same-sex civil partnership which is now legally dissolved and Widowed or surviving partner from a same-sex civil partnership.
* For the private renting indicator, we added together the number of people in the rented categories, which included Council (Local authority), Other social rented, Private landlord or letting agency and Other. 
* For the moved indicator, we subtracted all people in the datazone from those that lived at the same address one year ago. 

**Q1: The moved indicator includes people that moved within the same datazone, should these people be non-movers?**

**A1: We reason that high levels of short range movement would seem to be an aspect of high population transience in general. **

The number of people who corresponded to each indicator was then divided by the population denominator:

* For the unmarried indicator this was: All people aged 16 and over
* For the living alone indicator this was: All people aged over 16 in the household
* For the private rented indicator this was: All households
* For the moved indicators this was: All people

**Q2: These are the denominators supplied with the data, are these the most appropriate to use?**

**A2: These seem to be the most appropriate for each indicator. **

The percentage of people in each datazone corresponding to each indicator condition was then standardised by taking a z-score. Finally the SFI was created by adding together the indicator z-scores and then standardising once more. 

**Q3: Should we be taking the z-score of the summed z-scores?**

**A3: This is not shown in the data spreadsheet but is written in the data manipulation code below. We believe that this is appropriate and aides interepretation.**

The SFI was then visualised on a map for the four largest Scottish cities: Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee.

```


* In Edinburgh the highest SFI is recorded in S01002028, which is just north-east of Newington

* SFI is also higher in the Old town, Marchmont and Tollcross. 

* The highest areas of SFI are clustered around the Meadows datazone (S01002066).

```{r edinburgh, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Edinburgh
EDIboundary<-subset(boundary, Council=="S12000036")
library(mapview)
mapView(EDIboundary, zcol="SFI")
```


* In Glasgow the highest SFI is recorded in S01003368, which is just east of the Merchant City

* SFI is also higher in central Glasgow but also in Townhead, Kelvinhaugh, East Park and Hillhead.

```{r glasgow, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Glasgow
GLAboundary<-subset(boundary, Council=="S12000046")
library(mapview)
mapView(GLAboundary, zcol="SFI")
```


* In Aberdeen the highest SFI is recorded in S01000129, which is just north-west of the City Centre

* SFI is also higher going northwards, with the Donside village being another high area of SFI


```{r aberdeen, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Aberdeen
ABEboundary<-subset(boundary, Council=="S12000033")
library(mapview)
mapView(ABEboundary, zcol="SFI")
```


* In Dundee the highest SFI is recorded in S01001095, which is just south west of the city centre

```{r dundee, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Dundee
DUNboundary<-subset(boundary, Council=="S12000042")
library(mapview)
mapView(DUNboundary, zcol="SFI")
```


* The key to the spatial distribution of SFI in the major cities is the location of the universities and student accommodation (Aberdeen- Hillhead Student Village, Edinburgh- Pollock Halls).

## Is there a relationship with deprivation at a single point in time (2011)?

* A scatterplot was create using SFI and SIMD score (higher score more deprived), with colour representing the local authority and marker size representing the population density. 
* Double click on the local authority name on the right hand side will subset the data to just these data points.

* Single clicking on another local authority name will add these data points to the graph

```{r scatter, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
boundarySIMD<-readr::read_csv("SFI_SIMD_data.csv")
#boundarySIMD <- merge(boundary, simd, by.x="DZ_CODE", by.y="DataZone2001")
#boundarySIMD<-as.data.frame(boundarySIMD)
#boundarySIMD$density<-boundarySIMD$total_pop_2010/boundarySIMD$Shape_Area
#boundarySIMD$densityZ<-as.numeric(scale(boundarySIMD$density, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))
#boundarySIMD<-subset(boundarySIMD, select=c("LAname", "densityZ", "simd2012score", "SFI", "DZ_CODE", "DZ_NAME"))
library(plotly)
plot_ly(boundarySIMD, x = ~SFI, y = ~simd2012score, color = ~LAname, size= ~densityZ,text = ~paste("Datazone: ", DZ_CODE, '<br>Datazone name:', DZ_NAME))
```

* The graphs show that there is no association between SFI and deprivation. From previous calculation of SFI using different criteria, we know that this association is sensitive to the way that the renting indicator is calculated (i.e. including people that are private renting, as in this defintion of SFI, only results if weak association with deprivation).


## Unpicking the SFI indicators

```{r correlation, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=F}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(reshape)
library(Hmisc)
boundaryCORR<-subset(boundary, select=grep("*Zscore", names(boundary)))
boundaryCORR$geometry<-NULL
y <- as.matrix(boundaryCORR)
rt <- rcorr(y)
mtlr <- melt(rt$r)
mtlp <- melt(rt$P) 
p.value <- mtlp$value
gx <- ggplot(mtlr, aes(X1, X2, fill = value, label=p.value)) + geom_tile() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "cyan",  high = "red")
ggplotly(gx)
```

* The correlation between the indicators was calculated using Pearson's rank correlation coefficients. We found high correlation between rented and moved (r=0.77), and unmarried and living alone (r=0.95) indicators.

* Variation in the indicator z-scores was then calculated the standard deviation of the z-scores for each datazone, and the results plotted against the SFI below.

```{r variation, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#boundaryCORR<-subset(boundary, select=grep("SFI|LAname|DZ_CODE|*Zscore", names(boundary)))
#boundaryCORR<-as.data.frame(boundaryCORR)
#boundaryCORR$geometry<-NULL
#write.csv(boundaryCORR, "indicatorCORR.csv", row.names=F)

boundaryCORR<-read.csv("indicatorCORR.csv")
#boundaryCORR$geometry<-NULL
library(matrixStats)
boundaryCORR$SD<-apply(boundaryCORR[2:5],1,sd)
plot_ly(boundaryCORR, x=~SFI, y = ~SD, color = ~LAname,text = ~paste("Datazone: ", DZ_CODE))
```

* Let's take a closer look at the two outliers in Stirling (S01006151) and Moray (S01004285).

```{r Stirling, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Stirling
STIboundary<-subset(boundary, Council=="S12000030")
library(mapview)
mapView(STIboundary, zcol="SFI")
```

* S01006151 is located to the north of the city of Stirling and just east of the Bridge of Allan and contains the the University of Stirling main campus. The indicator which causes the high standard deviation is movement in the last year, which is extremely high at 85% of people. 

```{r moray, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Moray
MORboundary<-subset(boundary, Council=="S12000020")
library(mapview)
mapView(MORboundary, zcol="SFI")
```

* S01004285 is located west of Moray, near Kinloss. This neighbourhood has a high percentage of people that have moved into the last year (75%). The reason for the high flux in the area is likely to be due to the nearby Kinloss barracks (north of the datazone).

# Conclusions 

Social fragmentation does not associate with greater socio-economic deprivation. Spatial distribution of SFI is partly due to high student populations who tend to be privately renting, living alone, unmarried and have high movement within the last year, and reside in relatively affluent areas. Correlation between the indicators varies, with renting and movement within the last year, and unmarried and living alone highly correlated. There are some neighbourhoods with very high variation in SFI indicators. We highlighted datazones where this was the case, and noticed that high movement of people for occupation of education reasons was responsible. 

# Update (October 2018)

We have now calcualted the social fragmentation index for 2001 as well. This allows us to now understand change in social fragmentation from 2001-2011. 

```{r change, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
SFI2001 <- readr::read_csv("SFI2001.csv")
SFI2011 <- readr::read_csv("SFI2011.csv")

SFIchange<-merge(SFI2001, SFI2011, by="Datazone2001")
SFIchange$change<-SFIchange$SFI- SFIchange$`SFI 2001`
SFIchange<-subset(SFIchange, select=c("Datazone2001", "change"))

SFIchange$Normalized = (SFIchange$change-min(SFIchange$change))/(max(SFIchange$change)-min(SFIchange$change))

SFIchange$Normalized1000<-round(SFIchange$Normalized*1000, 0)

SIMD2012<-read.csv("SFI_SIMD_data.csv")
SFIchange<-merge(SFIchange, SIMD2012, by.x="Datazone2001", by.y="DZ_CODE")

library(plotly)
plot_ly(SFIchange, x = ~simd2012score, y = ~change, color = ~LAname,text = ~paste("Datazone: ", Datazone2001, '<br>Datazone name:', DZ_NAME))
```

* There seems to be a positive relationship between deprivation and change in SFI from 2001-2011 in most local authorities. 

* The next steps are to build a model using deprivation and SFI at both time points.
