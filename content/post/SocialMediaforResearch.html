<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Social media is becoming the dominant platform for getting information, for the general population by superseding television and newspapers and increasingly for academics, displacing peer-reviewed journal articles. Time is limited and short communications are easier to digest, especially when on a mobile.</p>
<p>To summarise findings from a research project or engage in an academic/policy debate in very short social media snippets is an impressive skill and one that I am keen to learn. This was the motivation behind going on the Research Support Office event on <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/arts-humanities-soc-sci/research-ke/support-for-staff/staff-development/learning-lunches-events/using-social-media-to-engage-research-end-users">‘Using social media to engage research end users’</a>. I’ve written down a few thoughts from the event below:</p>

<div id="why-use-social-media" class="section level2">
<h2>Why use social media?</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Dissemination - share cutting-edge research</li>
<li>Listening - retweet/like other research (a personalised newsfeed)</li>
<li>Connecting - reuse content and feedback to contributors, get advice on research from peers, conference hashtag (if it’s your event make sure hashtag isn’t already taken!)</li>
<li>Interacting - plan ahead, make it regular, half an hour a day?</li>
</ol>
<p>They recommended that to start it might be useful to have a go with two types of social media platforms:</p>

<div id="types-of-social-media" class="section level2">
<h2>Types of social media</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Project blog - Keep it short (&lt; 500 words) and informal, UoE has an <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/blogging">in-house service for Wordpress blogging</a>, which comes with lots of support (e.g. security, GDPR compliancy)</li>
<li>Twitter - always include imagery (and make it fun)</li>
<li>Facebook - good for events</li>
<li>E-newsletter</li>
<li>Infographics</li>
<li>Video/Audio channels</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a number of free open source software to help with getting started:</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">Tweetdeck</a> - schedule tweets for times of day (some times/days more effective - most effective times are subject specific)</li>
<li><a href="https://wakelet.com/findoutmore.html">Wakelet</a> - gather social media data to tell a story (for an event for example)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> - online graphic design for images, infographics etc.</li>
