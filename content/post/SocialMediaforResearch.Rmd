## Background
Social media is becoming the dominant platform for getting information, for the general population by superseding television and newspapers and increasingly for academics, displacing peer-reviewed journal articles. Time is limited and short communications are easier to digest, especially when on a mobile. 

To summarise findings from a research project or engage in an academic/policy debate in very short social media snippets is an impressive skill and one that I am keen to learn. This was the motivation behind going on the Research Support Office event on ['Using social media to engage research end users'](https://www.ed.ac.uk/arts-humanities-soc-sci/research-ke/support-for-staff/staff-development/learning-lunches-events/using-social-media-to-engage-research-end-users). 

I've written down a few thoughts from the event below:

## Why use social media?
1. Dissemination - share cutting-edge research
2. Listening - retweet/like other research (a personalised newsfeed)
3. Connecting - reuse content and feedback to contributors, conference hashtag (if it's your event make sure hashtag isn't already taken!)
4. Interacting - plan ahead, make it regular, half an hour a day?

They recommended that to start it might be useful to have a go with two types of social media platforms:

## Types of social media
1. Project blog - Keep it short (< 500 words) and informal, UoE has an [in-house service for Wordpress blogging](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/blogging), which comes with lots of support (e.g. security, GDPR compliancy)
2. Twitter - always include imagery (and make it fun)
3. Facebook - good for events
4. E-newsletter 
5. Infographics
6. Video/Audio channels

There is a number of free open source software to help with getting started:

## Software
1. [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) - schedule tweets for times of day (some times/days more effective - most effective times are subject specific)
2. [Wakelet](https://wakelet.com/findoutmore.html) - gather social media data to tell a story (for an event for example)
3. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) - online graphic design for images, infographics etc. 
4. Google/twitter analytics - measuring engagement
