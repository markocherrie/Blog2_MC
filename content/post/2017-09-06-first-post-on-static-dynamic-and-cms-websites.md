## Welcome
Welcome to my first post. As an avid R user, I was amazed at how quickly it was to setup a static website with the help from the R package ["blogdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I though Yihui Xie gave a convincing argument for blogging from his personal experience (Appendix D in above website). IN summary he provides three reasons for being in favour of blogging: 
* To consolidate thoughts and create a clearer argument for topics that are important to you.
* To engage with other people and get helpful feedback.
* To remember things that you have done so that they can be re-used in new applications.

I already try to do the first two points in my day-to-day life, although what I find is that they are either quite time consuming (e.g. giving a tutorial or presentation) or fleeting (e.g. conversations with friends and family), a blog fits nicely in between. I have started to make progress on the third point by having a github repository for [helpful code]("https://github.com/markocherrie/Helpful_Code") but this tends to be more of a dump of things that I have found useful rather than
