# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Our health and mobility are intrinsically linked with the quality of our local environment. All sorts of things affect us, from housing density and neighbourhood deprivation to access to green space. In Topic 3, we are exploring how physical, built and social environments evolve over time and how they impact on inequalities in health-related mobility as people move into older age. We will be using data from 1,641 people in their 70s and 90s, together with temporal, area-level measures of their current, recent and past environment."
