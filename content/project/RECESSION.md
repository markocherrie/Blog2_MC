# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "This ESRC funded project was aimed at exploring how the 'Great Recession' and the subsequent austerity measures affected mental health. The project made use of novel administrative data linkages, in particular NHS prescriptions. The project aimed to understand whether area level changes due to the recession and austerity impacted people's mental health, in addition to individual factors such as employment status. We also explore the potential for area level measures to 'buffer' these effects, by creating resilience to stress."
