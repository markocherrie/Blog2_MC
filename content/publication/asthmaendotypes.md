abstract = "Asthma is phenotypically diverse condition and has a complex aetiology. We aimed to investigate the association between adulthood vitamin D status and atopic/non-atopic asthma in a British cohort. The 1958 Birth Cohort is a geographically representative study of British citizens born in March 1958. The cohort were re-contacted in 2002 – 2004 at age 45; a questionnaire was colpleted and vitamin D status and IgE measurements were taken in a subset of those still living in the UK (n = 6688). The self-reported asthma outcome data is from the eighth sweep, at age 50. Atopic status was based on total IgE over 30 kU/l and specific IgE concentrations of over 0.35 kU/l. Logistic regression, stratified by atopy, was undertaken accounting for sex, socio-economic position in adulthood, smoking, obesity and physical activity. Vitamin D status was inversely associated with non-atopic asthma, comparing the highest to lowest quartile (OR, 0.58;95% CI, 0.40–0.86). A similar result was recorded when airflow obstruction measurements (sex and height standardised FEV1/FVC below 70%) were used to define asthma. The relationship with atopic asthma was shown to be insignificant. There is evidence from an Australian cohort which provides support for the results observed. We have used guidelines on analysing atopic and non-atopic asthma published recently and shown that a higher vitamin D status may have a protective effect on non-atopic asthma. Further work must focus on understanding the characteristics of individuals susceptible to the development of non-atopic asthma and elucidate how a sufficient vitamin D status can be maintained throughout the year, both of which are required to inform controlled trials."
