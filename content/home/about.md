# Biography

My research lies within the disciplines of environmental epidemiology and health geography. My focus is on the concept of the [exposome](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/1/24/650703) - the totality of environmental exposures from cradle to grave. I am guided by the [life course of place](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tran.12246) approach and the [uncertain geographic context problem](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00045608.2012.687349), which I use to design studies aimed at understanding the influence of social, economic and environmental circumstances on health inequalities.  

I'm currently working at the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health <a href="https://cresh.org.uk/">(CRESH)</a>, University of Edinburgh. On this site you'll find a record of my work and current interests which will be updated monthly.
