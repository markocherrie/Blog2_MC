# Biography

I am a researcher currently working at the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health <a href="https://cresh.org.uk/">(CRESH)</a>. In the Projects, Publications and Teaching sections you'll find a record of my academic career. I am going to update the site periodically to document my current interests in the Posts section.
