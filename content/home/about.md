# Biography

My research lies within the disciplines of environmental epidemiology and health geography. My focus is on the concept of the [exposome](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/1/24/650703) - the totality of 'environmental' exposures from cradle to grave. I use a [life course of place](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tran.12246) approach alongside novel methods to address the [uncertain geographic context problem](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00045608.2012.687349). My goal is to understand how we interact with the natural and built environment to inform policy and technological developments to reduce the gap in health between the most and least advantaged in society.  

I'm currently working at the Institute of Occupational Medicine <a href="https://www.iom-world.org/">(IOM)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences">School of Geosciences</a> at the University of Edinburgh. On this site you'll find a record of my work and current interests, which will be updated monthly.
