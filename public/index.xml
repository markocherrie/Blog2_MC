&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built environment is constantly changing. Whether it be short-term changes - e.g. roadworks, or long-term, e.g. a new road. These changes can impact exposures (air pollutants from road traffic), behaviours (decision to drive to work) or health (risk of being in a traffic accident). It’s therefore important to monitor the changes to the built environment so that interventions can be developed to reduce risk to health either directly or indirectly (exposure/behaviour). Monitoring the built environment can be done through remote sensing, surveying, crowdsourcing or administrative data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;remote-sensing&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Remote Sensing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellites can be equipped with instruments that collect information on reflected light, which can be used to infer &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.markcherrie.net/post/gee/&#34;&gt;changes in vegetation&lt;/a&gt; and therefore by the inverse - the (non-vegetated) built environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;surveying&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Surveying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mixture or remote sensing (aerial photography) and surveying is used to create the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/what-we-do&#34;&gt;Ordnance Survey’s (OS) databases&lt;/a&gt;. The OS Open Map Local data has been used by the CRESH/SPHSU team to understand changes in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cresh.org.uk/2019/08/02/an-atlas-of-change-in-scotlands-built-environment-2016-17/&#34;&gt;buildings, roads and woodlands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;crowdsourcing&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crowdsourcing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fixmystreet.com/&#34;&gt;FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt; website was developed using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet&#34;&gt;web-based reporting platform&lt;/a&gt; by the group - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mysociety.org/&#34;&gt;MySociety&lt;/a&gt; to allow people to record local problems, e.g. graffiti, fly tipping, broken paving slabs, or street lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;administrative-data-collection&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Administrative data collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we might use data collected by local and national government. The CRESH team used this kind of information to populate the database on location of &lt;a href=&#34;https://creshmap.com/shiny/alcoholtobacco/&#34;&gt;alcohol and tobacco retailers in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. The webmap visualises the data for 2012 and 2016. The alcohol retailer data is manually collected by requesting this licensing information from each of the 32 Scottish local authorities. The tobacco retailer data is collected in a centralised register, available online. Therefore for tobacco retailers we can assess change at shorter time intervals by querying the online database. This blogpost uses the register for to two aims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;aims&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download tobacco retailers in Scotland automatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assess change in tobacco retailers over time (shorter interval than previously - 1 year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;method&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010, it became law that all tobacco retailers were required to register on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tobaccoregisterscotland.org/&#34;&gt;Scottish Tobacco Retailer Register (STRR)&lt;/a&gt;. From the 1 October 2017, all nicotine vapour retailers also had to register. A person who breaches the act three times in a two year period is banned (for upto 12 months) from the register and therefore selling tobacco in Scotland. An R script was created to download the tobacco register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(&amp;#39;rvest&amp;#39;)

# Specify the URL and then read the html

  STRR$Address&amp;lt;-as.character(STRR$Address)
  STRR$Address&amp;lt;-paste0(STRR$Address, &amp;quot;, Scotland&amp;quot;)
  STRR_df&amp;lt;-rbind(STRR_df, STRR)
}

write.csv(STRR_df,paste0(&amp;quot;data/STRR_&amp;quot;, Sys.Date(), &amp;quot;.csv&amp;quot;), row.names=F)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s compare two downloads of the STRR database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;STRR06&amp;lt;-read.csv(&amp;quot;data/STRR_2019-06-26.csv&amp;quot;)
STRR09&amp;lt;-read.csv(&amp;quot;data/STRR_2019-09-25.csv&amp;quot;)

diff &amp;lt;- data.frame(Address=setdiff(STRR09$Address, STRR06$Address))
STRRdiff&amp;lt;-merge(diff, STRR09, by=&amp;quot;Address&amp;quot;, all.x=T)

library(ggplot2)

STRRdiff %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(BusinessType)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =75, hjust = 1))

ggsave(&amp;quot;output/BusinessTypeChange.png&amp;quot;)

STRRdiff %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(LocalAuthority)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1))

ggsave(&amp;quot;output/LocalAuthorityChange.png&amp;quot;)

STRRdiff %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(ProductSold)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1))

ggsave(&amp;quot;output/ProductSold.png&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;results&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the 25th of June and 26th of September 2019, there were 187 additions to the STRR. The local authority with the greatest increase was Glasgow with 40 retailers, followed by Edinburgh and North Lanarkshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/SRTT_images/LocalAuthorityChange.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the increase (87 retailers) was from ‘Convenience stores’, but a notable increase was found in ‘Other retail’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/SRTT_images/BusinessTypeChange.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of retailers who had newly registered were selling both tobacco and nicotine vapour. Interestingly, there were more new registrations for nicotine vapour products only compared to tobacco only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/SRTT_images/ProductSold.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusion&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis shows the potential of monitoring places using administrative data. Patterns over a three month period were described and show differences in tobacco retailing in Scotland by geography, type of product and type of retailer. Future work will supplement previous analysis on &lt;a href=&#34;https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2019/01/28/tobaccocontrol-2018-054543.info&#34;&gt;tobacco retailer change in scotland&lt;/a&gt;, with more granular measures of change, which could be used to act, in a more timely manner, on clustering of products (i.e. availability of tobacco) in deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-workshop&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The workshop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Newton funded ‘research links’ workshop was designed to bring together 34 early career researchers in the fields of environmental science, ecology, computer science, urban planning, geography, public health, data sciences and modelling. It was held in Tongji University in Shanghai from the 2-4th of July 2019. The workshop aimed to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show-case the most recent research and knowledge advancement in the field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate state-of-the-art research and impact on policy and decision making (i.e. to improve environmental health in China and the UK)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage and support ECRs in collaborative work across disciplines, institutions, regions and countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create cross-disciplinary and cross-country links, and long-lasting collaborations to underpin future training or research collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the excellent presentations, discussions in between sessions and workshops, we developed ideas on a UK-China project on the spatial distribution of environmental conditions over time and how they contribute to health inequalities within cities, i.e. A lifecourse of place study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;environmental-injustice&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Environmental injustice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick recap, environmental injustice is the disproportionate exposure to environmental harms by people in certain social groups (e.g. by ethnicity and income).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;environmental-inequity-in-the-uk-and-china&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Environmental Inequity in the UK and China&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental injustice in the UK has been characterised for a range of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis&#34;&gt;pathogenic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435854/&#34;&gt;salutogenic&lt;/a&gt; factors. These include air pollution, climate - average temperature, industrial facilities (pathogenic), and greenspace and UV (salutogenic). A clear positive gradient exists between area-level ill health and multiple environmental deprivation, (Pearce et al., 2010), however this effect was most pronounced in the least income deprived areas showing that environmental injusice may not be a precusor to health inequalities like it is the US. This could change, with regards to air pollution, the least deprived areas have benefited most from recent environmental policy (Mitchell et al., 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An environmental crisis arose in China in the decades following the 1978 economic reform. Air pollution, water contamination, soil problems, biodivesity loss and mega projects are some of the biggest environmental issues, and have been exacerbated by natural disasters and high sensitivity to climate change. These have worsened due to the pace of urbanisation; for example, Shenzhen went from 3,148 residents in 1950 to over 12 million in 2017. The rural-to-urban population and the poor bear the greatest burden of environmental degradation. There is evidence that environmental injustice is being put on the agenda in China (Freeman and Lu, 2008), but not to the extent where it is “popular within environmental policy or civil society” (Mah and Wang, 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;green-space-inequity-in-the-uk-and-china-example&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Green space inequity in the UK and China Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Shenzhen, China, it was observed that people living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods had lower quantity of public greenspace, with worse access, but that quality was higher (You, 2016). This is at odds with the UK literature. In Sheffield, UK, it was observed that for people living in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods the quantity of public greenspace was lower, but access was &lt;strong&gt;better&lt;/strong&gt; and quality was &lt;strong&gt;lower&lt;/strong&gt; (Mears, 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of how inequity of environment will play out differently in the two countries. However, perhaps the differences are partly due to the way that the environment has been measured? In the first example quality is measured by &lt;a href=&#34;https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/articles/articles/general-background.html&#34;&gt;landscape metrics&lt;/a&gt;, in the second by a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Flag_Award&#34;&gt;quality assessment criteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;implications&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, environmental policies have not had the desired effect; in China, environmental policies have not been given priority. Environmental injustice plays out differently between the two countries. Some authors have promoted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnu.org/resources/what-new-urbanism&#34;&gt;new urbanism&lt;/a&gt; as a way to reduce environmental inequity and health inequalities (Iravani and Rao, 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/UKChina/newurbanism.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encouraging part of applying a new urbanism framework is that it could work; environmental injustice is not inevitable (e.g. Edinburgh has a flat relationship between income and air pollution). However, we need to contextualise environmental injustice &lt;strong&gt;within&lt;/strong&gt; countries as well as between - to understand it at the local level (Bailey et al., 2018). Improvements to the urban environment through remediation or provision of amenities, should be undertaken with plans to prevent the possibility of displacment of residents through land revaluation, investments and gentrification (Anguelovski, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Development of a lifeplace questionnaire</title>

&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts required to conduct a study on health and place across the lifecourse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longitudinal information on the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information on residential location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post focusses on the latter. This information might be collected prospectively via routine administrative records (e.g. GP location), which could be linked to health records. However, for a number of research questions we might want to also use non-routinely collected information (e.g. tobacco smoking history). This type of information is available in a number of cohort studies. To collect residential location in a cohort retrospectively the most common method is to ask the participant to fill out a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/projects/hvp/newsletters/holland3.htm&#34;&gt;lifegrid questionnnaire&lt;/a&gt;. Typically the questionnaire is structured with years in the first column and then columns for external events (filled in beforehand by the researcher), personal events, residential location and occupation. The participant then fills out the grid, with their memory being prompted by the global and (their own) personal events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/lifeplaces/lifegridexample.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;current-limitations&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst this method is very useful for gaining valuable residential location information, there are limitations. First, given that the grid is actually asking a large number of questions, it could generate response fatigue, which might lower the quality of information gained. Second, the written residential information needs to be digitised and then geocoded, which can be time-consuming. Third, the residential environment is only one area where environmental exposure takes place. We know that work, school, commuting routes and those for recreation vary in their importance, dependent on the particular environment-health relationship studied. For example, the difference in exposure between poorer/richer children to tobacco retailing goes from 2.3 to a 6 fold after accounting for places outside of the residential environment - on the way to/from school &lt;a href=&#34;https://cresh.org.uk/2019/07/10/children-in-deprived-areas-encounter-shops-selling-tobacco-six-times-more-frequently-than-those-in-well-off-areas/&#34;&gt;(Caryl, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the first two limitations might be solved by taking the questionnaire online. That is, designing an interface so that inputted information is opaque until saturation is achieved. By collecting digital information it can be then geocoded on-the-fly with a &lt;a href=&#34;github.com/LSCS-Projects/HAGGIS&#34;&gt;historical geocoder&lt;/a&gt;. The participant’s computing ability would have to be considered, and possibly a trained researcher would need to assist with data input in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final limitation is difficult in the context of not wanting to overburden the participant. However as it is so important for assessing their lifetime exposure, I think that information on places should be asked outside of a lifegrid questionnaire. That is, there could be two questionnaires - the traditional lifegrid (without residential locations) and a ‘lifeplace’ questionnaire which asks for information on locations in the full extent of the participant’s activity space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to develop a ‘lifeplace’ questionnaire we need to know how many places to ask about and how big a buffer we would set around these places to get an acceptable amount of their movement accounted for. I’ll now describe a mini-experiment that I did to try and answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;research-questions&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many places should we ask about in a lifeplace questionnaire?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What buffer size around these places would we need to capture most of the locations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;method&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I record location data on my iphone using &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;‘Arc App - Location &amp;amp; Activity’&lt;/a&gt;. This is a continuous measurement of my movement (providing I have my iphone with me, which is almost always). For this analysis I used data on 171,857 points from 169 days and 1223 hours of recording time. I deleted spurious locations (speed between points &amp;lt;160km/h; elevation &amp;lt;1345m).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;results&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand whether there were clusters of points I generated a heatmap of all the points and annotated them with descriptive labels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/lifeplaces/activityspace.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that there were 10 places that were hotspots for my location. I labelled these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary Home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary Home (Parent’s house)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary Work (Working in a safe haven)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary Travel (Travelling to primary work)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary Travel (Travelling to train station for work/recreation outside Edinburgh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary Recreation (Gym)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary Recreation (Shopping in town)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary Recreation (Hill walking)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quaternary Recreation (Wedding location)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these locations were temporary i.e. Secondary Work, which was due to me working with sensitive data in a safe haven environment away from my usual office, and Quaternary recreation, which was the location of my wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we were interested in the percentage of my location points in buffers of varying sizes surrounding the places above. I calculated the percentage of points within a range of buffers (0-10,000 m radius) for three scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home only (usual lifegrid questionnaire)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/lifeplaces/home.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that a very low percentage of movement points are accounted for by the home environment (even at a 2.5 km buffer we only account for 30% of the locations). The large increase in percentage of points at around 3 km is because the home buffer was encasing the work location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home and work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/lifeplaces/homework.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work buffer is set at half of the home buffer. So by using both the home and work/school we can account just 60% of the movement points if we set a 1.25 km home buffer and 625m work buffer. Even low buffer sizes of 500m (home) and 250m (work) can capture around 40% of the location points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifeplaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/lifeplaces/all.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifeplace buffers use the same proportion as above for recreation but keeping the routes constant at 200 m. This shows that with a 50 m home buffer, 25 m for all others (except 200 m for route), we can account for 50% of location points. There is a stable logarithmic growth, flattening around 5 km home buffer at around 80% of locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusions&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mini-experiment is limited in that it was only using my own data, but a strength is that it used a long time period (more than most GPS studies). My life stage is probably more stable in terms of movement than earlier (e.g. being a student) or later (e.g. early retirement) time periods. The conclusions are caveated by the need for replication in a cohort of varying age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. However, it does show that instead of only collecting information on the residential location, we would greatly improve the percentage of exposure ascertained by also collecting information on the work location. If a way of collecting several locations, without fatiguing the respondent, could be developed then we might be able to ascertain the majority (70-80%) of place-based exposure. We might consider eight locations, with the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary Home: What was your home address?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondary Home: Did you spend a lot of time in another home i.e. family/friends/partner? If so, where?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary Work: What was your work address?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondary Work: Did you spend any time in another work location? If so, where?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary Travel: Which route did you take to work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondary Travel: Are there any routes you took frequently for work/recreation during this time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary Recreation: Where did you spend most of your time for recreation? i.e. exercise, meeting friends, shopping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondary Recreation: Were there any special events that meant you spent more time in a particular location? If so, where?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buffer question really depends on the percentage of exposure the researcher requires for their study. The curves above can be used as a rule of thumb to determine which might be suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How to process information gathered on your mobile to get information on everyday exposure to greenspace?</title>

&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending time in the natural environment (green and blue spaces) is linked with better health outcomes throughout life. From prenatal/pregnancy, childhood, adolescence to adulthood and later adulthood, we benefit from being in these places. Briefly they provide opportunities for more social interactions and physical activity, a restoration in our attention, a reduction in stress and a more diverse microbial exposure &lt;a href=&#34;https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/8515&#34;&gt;(Douglas, 2017)&lt;/a&gt;. Greater access and use of greenspace may reduce health inequalities - it may be &lt;a href=&#34;https://cresh.org.uk/2013/11/08/what-is-equigenesis-and-how-might-it-help-narrow-health-inequalities/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;equigenic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the main question is: how do we plan, design and manage greenspaces so that they generate the benefits to those most in need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question we need to know the patterns of use. In doing so we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can think of this on a everyday or a lifecourse level. In this blog post I’m going to concentrate on the former. We often assume that people tend to spend most of their time the parks closest to their homes, however, at least in 10/11 year olds this is not always the case &lt;a href=&#34;http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/178909/1/178909.pdf&#34;&gt;(Olsen, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everday interations with greenspace can be classified by whether they are passive or active (ref), with active interactions showing most benefit for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After thousands of publications on the subject we still have little understanding of the ways in which these spaces are being used in daily life. We have assumed that we spend more time in parks that are closer to us, but is this the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is becoming the dominant platform for getting information, for the general population by superseding television and newspapers and increasingly for academics, displacing peer-reviewed journal articles. Time is limited and short communications are easier to digest, especially when on a mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise findings from a research project or engage in an academic/policy debate in very short social media snippets is an impressive skill and one that I am keen to learn. This was the motivation behind going on the Research Support Office event on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ed.ac.uk/arts-humanities-soc-sci/research-ke/support-for-staff/staff-development/learning-lunches-events/using-social-media-to-engage-research-end-users&#34;&gt;‘Using social media to engage research end users’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, what are the benefits of using social media to engage with research end users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-use-social-media&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why use social media?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissemination - share cutting-edge research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening - retweet/like other research (a personalised newsfeed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting - reuse content and feedback to contributors, conference hashtag (if it’s your event make sure hashtag isn’t already taken!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interacting - plan ahead, make it regular, half an hour a day?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be useful to have a go with two types of social media platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;types-of-social-media&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of social media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project blog - Keep it short (&amp;lt; 500 words) and informal, UoE has an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/blogging&#34;&gt;in-house service for Wordpress blogging&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with lots of support (e.g. security, GDPR compliancy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter - always include imagery (and make it fun)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook - good for events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-newsletter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infographics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video/Audio channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of free open source software are available to help get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;software&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/&#34;&gt;Tweetdeck&lt;/a&gt; - schedule tweets for times of day (some times/days more effective - most effective times are subject specific)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wakelet.com/findoutmore.html&#34;&gt;Wakelet&lt;/a&gt; - gather social media data to tell a story (for an event for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canva.com/&#34;&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt; - online graphic design for images, infographics etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google/twitter analytics - measuring engagement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/&#34;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; - free high resolution images&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The Geography of the Revoke Article 50 petition</title>
      <link>/post/geography_of_the_revoke_article_50_petition/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>


&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘Revoke article 50 and remain in the EU petition’ is the most popular petition ever, which aims to stop the brexit process. The rules are that after 10,000 signatures, petitions get a response from the government, after 100,000 signatures, petitions are considered for debate in Parliament and after 17.4 million, we stop Brexit (Andrea Leadsom, 2019). As of writing this (25/03/19 17:00 GMT), the petition has amassed over 5 million signatures. As a geographer, I wondered whether there were some places that were signing (read that as sighing on a proofread… probably accurate) a lot more than others and whether that was expected, given how their constituency voted in the referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;method&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the required data at the constituency level is publically available for: the number of signatures of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584?fbclid=IwAR2E3C5chLiMm9MM7awL2qWw_Fkr_KLXert0S61swiRbYORAfmOOglgZ8as&#34;&gt;‘Revoke article 50’ petition&lt;/a&gt;, boundaries of the constituencies with the data on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2017/04/getting-ready-for-ge2017-big-shapefile.html&#34;&gt;2015 electorate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/parliament-and-elections/elections-elections/brexit-votes-by-constituency/&#34;&gt;% voting to leave in the referendum&lt;/a&gt;. After merging these data together I first calculated the percentage of electorate who signed the petition. I then built a regression model using the electorate petition percentage as the dependent variable and the Brexit leave estimate as the independent variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis is that the areas with higher percentages of leave voters would have the lowest percentage of the electorate signing the petition. By studying the residuals we can see constituencies that are signing the petition more or less than we would expect (given the referendum vote). I visualised the data as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dannydorling.org/?page_id=3132&#34;&gt;cartogram&lt;/a&gt;, distorting the map to enlarge constituencies that had a) higher petition percentages b) higher-than-expected petition percentages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;results&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest percentages of petition signatures were: Hornsey and Wood Green (38%), Bristol West (37%), Cities of London and Westminster (37%), Brighton, Pavilion (35%) and Islington North (34%); and the lowest: Barnsley East (3%), Birmingham, Hodge Hill (3%), Doncaster North (3%), Dudley North (3%) and Easington (3%). Here’s the map of percentage of constituency signing the petition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/brexit_images/percentageofelectorate.png&#34; alt=&#34;Where have people been signing the petition?&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have people been signing the petition?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brexit referendum vote explained 69% of the variance of the petition signature percentage. For every percentage increase in the Brexit leave vote there was a -0.46% lower petition percentage (95% CI -0.48 to -0.44). There was a general North West/South East pattern in the model residuals, with much lower than expected petition percentages coming from Northern Ireland and much higher than expected petition percentages coming from London and Brighton. Here’s the cartogram on expected petition percentage given the referendum’s vote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/brexit_images/revokearticlebrexitref.png&#34; alt=&#34;Where has the petition had higher signatures than expected?&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where has the petition had higher signatures than expected?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusion&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584?fbclid=IwAR2E3C5chLiMm9MM7awL2qWw_Fkr_KLXert0S61swiRbYORAfmOOglgZ8as&#34;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you are in Northern England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and we might hit 17.4 million ☺&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to build a structural equation model in Lavaan</title>
      <link>/post/structural-equation-modelling-in-r/</link>

      <description>


&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychometrics.cam.ac.uk/trainingworkshops/structural-equation-modelling-in-r-4-day-course&#34;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge over the summer of 2018. This was to get me up to speed on structural equation modelling (SEM), which has a lot of potential applications in scenarios where the pathways between measured and unmeasured variables are the central focus of the research question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-sem&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is SEM?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEM is a mixture of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and path analysis. Another way to describe that, is that you have a measurement part and a structural part. They relate to two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we measure latent concepts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the relationship between the variables in our model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key point to structural equation modelling is that is splits measurement error and the correlation between the residuals from the structural coefficients. I recommend the Lavaan &lt;a href=&#34;http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/est.html&#34;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;; below is my workflow for building a mediation/moderation model in Lavaan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;lavaan-syntax&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lavaan syntax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all the syntax for Lavaan models is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~ Define regression formula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~~ Define correlated residual variances (two observed variables)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;=~ Define latent variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;:= Define effect (i.e. indirect or total)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you’ll need to define the model in speech marks and then use it as the model argument in the lavaan functions: cfa and sem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;example&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example is on understanding the pathways to smoking in adolescents. The density of tobacco retailers in an adolescents’ residential neighbourhood predicts propensity to smoke; the greater the density of retailers the more likely smoking is &lt;a href=&#34;https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/25/1/75.info&#34;&gt;(Shortt et al., 2014)&lt;/a&gt;. However we know that density also predicts whether a family member will smoke and that if a family member is a smoker, the adolescent is more likely to smoke. Also, we know that the relationship between density of retailer and smoking is stronger when the individual has a lower socioeconomic status or lives in an area of higher deprivation &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15965140&#34;&gt;(Chuang et al., 2005)&lt;/a&gt;. How can we model these latent contructs (family smoking) and complex relationships? This hypothetical dataset called ‘smokingdata’ has the following variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;density: continuous density of tobacco retailers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smoking: binary smoking status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;family: family smoking latent variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brother: measured variable on smoking status in brother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mother: measured variable on smoking status in mother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sister: measured variable on smoking status in sister&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;father: measured variable on smoking status in father&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deprivation: binary variable of deprivation in local neighbourhood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;construct-latent-variables-using-cfa&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Construct latent variables using CFA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage is to identify the latent constructs and the variables, which will be used to predict it (3 variables is minimum). Compare the model fit (use ‘fit.measures=T’) of several models and with what you expected given your reading of the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(lavaan)
cfa.model &amp;lt;- 
           &amp;#39; 
           # Measurement model
             family  =~ brother + mother + father + sister
           &amp;#39;
fit &amp;lt;- cfa(cfa.model, data = smokingdata, ordered=c(&amp;quot;brother&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;mother&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;father&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sister&amp;quot;))
summary(fit, fit.measures=TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mediation-model&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mediation Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to building a mediation model is to make sure the regressions are in the correct order. In the example above, we need to make sure density is regressed with smoking and family, and family is regressed with smoking. Additionally in Lavaan, we use labels (e.g. a, b, c) to define effects, which we can then manipulate to get the direct (density on smoking) and indirect effects (density on smoking through family smoking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mediation.model &amp;lt;- 
           &amp;#39; 
           # Measurement model
             family  =~ brother + mother + father + sister
           # Residual correlations
             brother ~~ father
             brother ~~ mother
             sister  ~~ mother
             sister  ~~ father
           # direct effect
             smoking ~ c*density
           # mediator
             family ~  a*density
             smoking ~ b*family
           # indirect effect 
             ab := a*b
           # total effect
             total := c + (a*b)
         &amp;#39;
fit &amp;lt;- sem(mediation.model, data = smokingdata, ordered=&amp;quot;smoking&amp;quot;)
summary(fit, fit.measures=TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;modification-indices-model-fit&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modification indices &amp;amp; Model fit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stage is to check the modification indices to understand whether adding pathways in your model would improve the fit. Crucially, these need to be validated by the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mi &amp;lt;- modindices(fit)
mi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example we did not originally include a residual correlation between sister and brother smoking status which probably would have had a high ‘mi’ value and therefore worthy of closer inspection. Once we have a model that we are happy with we can check the model fit. The model fit is calculated by comparing the sample variance/covariance matrix to a derived population sample variance/covariance matrix. There are a number statistics to determine goodness-of-fit (see references at the end of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;moderation-model&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moderation Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example we want to know if there are significant differences in the association between density and smoking by deprivation. This can be done by running a stratified model, and comparing the coefficients using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_test&#34;&gt;Sobel test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;moderation.model &amp;lt;- 
           &amp;#39; 
           # Measurement model
             family  =~ brother + mother + father + sister
           # Residual correlations
             brother ~~ father
             brother ~~ mother
             sister  ~~ mother
             sister  ~~ father
           # direct effect
             smoking ~ c(c1,c2)*density
           # mediator
             family ~  c(a1,a2)*density
             smoking ~ c(b1,b2)*family
          
           # Group 1 - low deprivation
             DirectLOW:= c1
             IndirectLOW:= (a1*b1)
             TotalLOW:= c1 + (a1*b1)
            
           # Group 2 - High deprivation 
             DirectHIGH:= c2
             IndirectHIGH:= (a2*b2)
             TotalHIGH:= c2 + (a2*b2)

           # Sobel test
            DirectDIFF := DirectLOW-DirectHIGH
            IndirectDIFF := IndirectLOW-IndirectHIGH
            TotalDIFF := TotalLOW-TotalHIGH
         &amp;#39;
fit &amp;lt;- sem(moderation.model, data = smokingdata, ordered=&amp;quot;smoking&amp;quot;, group=&amp;quot;deprivation&amp;quot;)
summary(fit, fit.measures=TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;standardized-estimates-and-plotting&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Standardized estimates and plotting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, you will want to get standardized estimates for the models using the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;standardizedSolution(fit)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also be interested to plot the model as a figure using &lt;a href=&#34;http://sachaepskamp.com/semPlot/examples&#34;&gt;‘semPlot’&lt;/a&gt;; an alternative is to construct it yourself using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yworks.com/products/yed&#34;&gt;Yed&lt;/a&gt;, with the output that you have generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How to quickly visualise massive spatio-temporal data</title>

      <description>


&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you collecting lots of geospatial data and need a way to quickly visualise what you’ve got? Read on! I had this problem; I was collecting a lot of information on my daily movements from &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arc-app-location-activity/id1063151918?mt=8&#34;&gt;Arc App: Location and Activity&lt;/a&gt; (more on the use of Arc for research later). Additionally, I wanted to quickly see what features of the urban environment (e.g. greenspaces) I was being ‘exposed’ to. The solution was Uber’s open source geospatial analysis tool: &lt;a href=&#34;https://kepler.gl&#34;&gt;Kepler.gl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;method&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some formatting of your data is required, but it’s pretty simple, just output a CSV with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/as.POSIXlt.html&#34;&gt;datetime&lt;/a&gt;, latitude and longitude column, alongside any other attribute data that you are interested in (here I’m interested in greenspace exposure, i.e. when I was within 50 metres of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-greenspace.html&#34;&gt;greenspace&lt;/a&gt;). That’s the hard bit. After this, you have lots of options for styling your visualisation. You receive an automatic animation of your data over time, which you have control of with a set of buttons to determine playback. A notable, but more time-consuming, alternative to creating animations from data is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@tjukanov/geogiffery-in-a-nutshell-introduction-to-qgis-time-manager-31bb79f2af19&#34;&gt;QGIS Time manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Once you like the look of your visualisation, there are options to share as an image or a URL. If, like me, you want to do furthering editing (e.g. annotate certain frames) then you can do a screen recording and then import to a video editing program such as iMovie (n.b. There is probably a better way of doing this). Anyway, hopefully this blog will give enough information to get started with kepler.gl. I was able to create a visualisation of my contact with greenspaces over a 6 months period, which is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;visualisation&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visualisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/5K49kbiK-Q0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am keen to employ technology to assist in teaching. I went to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://socsocmed.org.uk/annual-scientific-meeting/&#34;&gt;Social Science and Medicine Annual Scientific meeting&lt;/a&gt; in Glasgow last September and noticed that they were using software to get responses from the audience. The software was called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mentimeter.com/&#34;&gt;Mentimeter&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out there has been a &lt;a href=&#34;http://evs.psy.gla.ac.uk/papers/draperbrown.pdf&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published by researchers from the University of Glasgow on the merits of interactive polling for teaching. The authors summarise that experiences of this technology are generally positive but caution that future use should focus first on the pedagogical approach. Two approaches are put forward: 1) launching student discussion, and 2) to focus on developing teaching aligned to the students questions and needs. I’ll now give a brief description on how to carry out a Mentimeter polling session and how I have used it in teaching and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mentimeter&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mentimeter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentimeter is proprietary cloud-based software that can collect, record and visualise participant responses via interaction with a webpage. The teacher first asks the students to go onto the webpage and input a code to get to the right question (questions are created on the Mentimeter site, which is very intuitive). The teacher then activates the voting and results are visualised in real-time on the screen. I’ve found the easiest way to include polls in a presentation is to use the Powerpoint &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mentimeter.com/powerpoint&#34;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt;. The plots and data can then be downloaded and are useful for reports after the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;examples-of-use&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples of use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching: Honing in on plans for dissertations by asking what type of data students anticipate collecting, to stimulate discussion on the merits of these data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outreach: Developing a structural equation model by asking experts to categorise pathways by their strength of association with outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;thoughts-on-use&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of an internet-enabled device can be exclusionary, if possible there should be devices that can be used by students that are ready to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the previous point, it might be beneficial to mix more traditional interactive methods (e.g. the Carousel Activity) with the new technology so there’s a greater chance that people feel comfortable with the type of interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data and plots generated from interactive polling are so useful for reflection and it is much less time-consuming than transcribing hand written notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be limitations to the type of questions that can be asked and the type of answers that can be supplied (e.g. doodles). In relation to the first point, especially in small groups with questions that might be more personal (i.e. related to their project) some students might not feel confident having their answers shared among the group, and this should be respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although I have found the technology to be robust, there are always going to be challenges with connectivity. The polling should be a pivot point not the key part of the teaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would think that spending more time on getting everyone up to speed with the concept of polling and having fewer key questions is better than trying to fit in lots of questions (also relates to student &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=response+fatigue&amp;amp;oq=response+fatigue&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2592j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&#34;&gt;respondent fatigue&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your experiences with interactive polling for teaching/outreach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How can we understand patterns of prescription use?</title>

      <description>


&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal analysis is important as due to the temporal sequence of exposure then outcome, we can make a stronger case for causality. A derivative of a class of models that fit into the ‘data-mining’ family is sequence analysis. One use of this model is to understand lifetime states, e.g. being employed, being in education, being retired. By understanding these state sequences we can understand how the duration and timing of a state can affect health in the long term. An excellent R package that allows you to conduct sequence analysis is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TraMineR/index.html&#34;&gt;TraMineR&lt;/a&gt; package. Here I’m going to describe how traminer can be used to understand patterns in prescription use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;sequence-analysis&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sequence Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in sequence analysis is to format the dataset into wide format (time as columns and unit of observation as rows). The function in R to define the sequence is ‘seqdef’. Once we have this object, step 2 is to create visualisations using ‘seqplot’. There are many to choose from, I like the index plot (use argument, ‘type=I’), which shows you all the sequences, so is a raw look at the diversity of sequences (n.b. I recommend using the argument ‘sort=“from.start”’ to get a clearer picture). I also like the distribution plot (‘type=d’); this is a summary of the percentages for each time point that correspond to each state. You can then use the group argument to understand difference by the covariates (refer to your original dataframe with the information on for example, sex, age etc.). There are a number of metrics that can be calculated on the sequence including length, duration of distinct states, transition rates, Shannon entropy and turbulence. These are all descriptive statistics to understand the stability of the sequences over time. Step 3 is to understand sequence dissimilarity, i.e. to calculate how close two sequences are. There are a number of dissimilarity measures (e.g. longest common prefix, optimal matching). The latter is commonly used and is based on how many edits, deletions and substitutions it takes to get from one sequence to another; the result is a ‘cost’ of transformation. Generally there tends to be measures that favour sequencing (e.g. when and what order) or timing (e.g. how long in a state). Step 4 is to use the dissimilarity measure with one of two families for clustering (e.g. hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids; using ‘WeightedCluster’ package). The researcher has to specify the number of groups and then assess the cluster quality by looking at several measures (e.g. average silhouette width; -1 to 1; higher is better), and interpret them in relation to the literature. The final stage is to use the cluster groups in a regression analysis as covariates or outcome variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define sequence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualise and descriptive statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequence dissimilarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clustering (create clusters, assess quality of clusters, interpret them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression with cluster groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;example&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://thebest.shinyapps.io/Sequence/&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; is a simulated dataset on 6-month status of prescription use. If the participant has had a prescription in the last 6 months they are defined as a cases, and subdivided by old/new (whether they had prescriptions in the first 6 months), relapse/norelapse (whether they have come off prescriptions for 6 months and then back on), recurrence/remission (whether on/off prescriptions by the end of the time period); If they have never been prescribed they are classified as “Never”. The app first gives a description of the simulated dataset, the state distribution, state index and state distributions by cluster group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
