      <title>Alcohol and Tobacco Environments in Scotland</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I led the re-development of the CRESH &lt;a href=&#34;https://creshmap.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;webmap&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally launched in 2015. This app was designed to allow users to map tobacco and alcohol outlet density, and related health outcomes for small areas in Scotland (i.e. datazones, which represent around 5,000 residents).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is increasing evidence which shows that the density of tobacco and alcohol retailers has an effect on both smoking/drinking behaviours but also the associated morbidity/mortality. For example those living in areas with the highest density of retailers have double the alcohol-related death rate; and adolescents living in areas with the highest density of tobacco retailers are 50% more likely to smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alcohol retailer data was collected from representatives of the 32 local authorities, and required months of cleaning to have it ready for the webmap. In the redevelopment we tried to make the information accessible and clearly presented. In addition, we really pushed to make the data easy to download, to empower local communities so that they are more involved in the decisions on the built environment surrounding their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CRESH webmap was created in partnership with Alcohol Focus Scotland (AFS) and Action on Smoking and Health Scotland (ASH Scotland). The original research was funded by the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy and we have received funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) to publicise our research and make it more accessible to the public and policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analysing the Association between Ultraviolet Radiation, Vitamin D and Allergic Disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Atopic diseases are common in the UK, with eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis typically developing sequentially during childhood, as in the theory of the &amp;lsquo;atopic march&amp;rsquo;. Some people will &amp;lsquo;grow out&amp;rsquo; out of these diseases but others face lifelong morbidity. Current figures from asthma UK show that the prevalence of people in the UK receiving treatment for asthma is approximately 9% in children and 8% of adults. These rates have risen since the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, evidenced by the an increase in prevalence rates between the ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) phase one (1994) and phase three (&lt;sup&gt;2002&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2003&lt;/sub&gt;). The trend is the same for developing nations. Thus, it is clear that these diseases will represent a significant burden to individual families and national healthcare providers around the world for the foreseeable future. Atopic diseases have a complex aetiology, but are broadly caused by environmental and genetic factors. It is through geographical analysis of the distribution of these diseases that hypotheses can be generated. For example, in the UK, eczema has been mapped using data from the CLSâ€™s (Centre of Longitudinal Studies) 1958 Birth Cohort, this study implicated factors such as water hardness, industrial pollution, pollen, heavy metal deposits and climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of my PhD &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cy1xxwsGX7nN6rMeIvkDkj2CCbbsVYIj?usp=sharing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; was to investigate the association between UVR (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mindmeister.com/172005637?t=CCFm9l6zxY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ultraviolet Radiation&lt;/a&gt;) exposure on allergic disease incidence using secondary data sources. Ultraviolet radiation is the primary contributor to vitamin D levels, often quoted to contribute 80-90% of an individual&amp;rsquo;s circulating 25(OH)D. Vitamin D has been linked to several immune functions within the body including Treg production (which in turn modulates Th1/Th2 balance) and antimicrobial peptide induction, which protects against infection. Vitamin D could play an important role in reducing risk of atopic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
