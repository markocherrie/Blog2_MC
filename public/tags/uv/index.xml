      <description>Atopic diseases are common in the UK, with eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis typically developing sequentially during childhood, as in the theory of the &amp;lsquo;atopic march&amp;rsquo;. Some people will &amp;lsquo;grow out&amp;rsquo; out of these diseases but others face lifelong morbidity. Current figures from asthma UK show that the prevalence of people in the UK receiving treatment for asthma is approximately 9% in children and 8% of adults. These rates have risen since the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, evidenced by the an increase in prevalence rates between the ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) phase one (1994) and phase three (2002&amp;frasl;2003).</description>
