      <description>The Medical &amp;amp; Environmental Data Mash-up Infrastructure project is aiming to connect diverse databases to improve our understanding of the links between climate, environment, and human health. View the projectâ€™s full site at www.data-mashup.org.uk
To support rapid, novel, and rigorous research in these areas, MEDMI will link and analyse complex meteorological, environmental and epidemiological data, through the use of the emerging data &amp;ldquo;mash-up&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; field of computational science.
Existing databases stored in various locations and organisations will be combined in a consistent temporal and spatial framework, creating an internet based platform that will enable data on a host of variables to be mapped and interrogated.</description>
