      <description>BackgroundSpending time in the natural environment (green and blue spaces) is linked with better health outcomes throughout life. From prenatal/pregnancy, childhood, adolescence to adulthood and later adulthood, we benefit from being in these places. Briefly they provide opportunities for more social interactions and physical activity, a restoration in our attention, a reduction in stress and a more diverse microbial exposure (Douglas, 2017). Greater access and use of greenspace may reduce health inequalities - it may be equigenic.</description>

Additionally, I wanted to quickly see what features of the urban environment (e.g. greenspaces) I was being ‘exposed’ to. The solution was Uber’s open source geospatial analysis tool: Kepler.</description>
