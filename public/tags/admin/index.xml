      <title>What are the optional courses like for UoE Geosciences Msc students?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The aim was to understand more about the optional courses available for Geosciences MSc students. This meant building a dataframe that contained the interesting bits of information available on the University of Edinburgh website so that I could query it to find out answers to questions such as: How many 10 credit courses are available? Which degree cluster do the courses below to and where do they overlap? What kind of topics/skills are going to be taught? and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do was to download the data from the University of Edinburgh website. Here is the code, which first builds the URL’s that we need and then scrapes the relevant info one-by-one into a dataframe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step was to apply some cleaning, this was a iterative process of identifying issues with the output above and applying correction. Have a look at the code comments for more details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, onto the fun part, querying the data and producing graphs to present answers to the questions I was interested in. First let’s see the percentage of courses that are 10 and 20 credits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/MscCourses_files/figure-html/visualisation1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    10.0    10.0    20.0    16.3    20.0    20.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we can see that 1/3 of the optional courses are currently 10 credits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I want to see how they relate to the degree clusters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/MscCourses_files/figure-html/visualisation2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EOGM has the most unique master courses (10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EOGM and GIS share 11 courses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is only one course listed in all of the masters (Principles and Practice of Remote Sensing (PGGE11233))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I’m interested in the assessment breakdown (coursework, written exam and practical exam):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/MscCourses_files/figure-html/visualisation3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## C0W100P0 C100W0P0 C40W60P0 C50W50P0 
##        2       18        2        5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s have a look at the learning outcomes, which will give me an understanding of the topics and skills that the student will have experience of by the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/MscCourses_files/figure-html/visualisation4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is probably a lot more that can be done with the data but this is a just a taster. In addition, these are the optional course for Geosciences but this could be applied to other schools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Removing pages from a PDF</title>
      <link>/post/pdf/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More of a note than a post but hopefully this can help someone else out having the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to remove a couple of pages from a PDF document today. This can be done easily on a mac using preview (i.e. backspace when the page thumbnail is highlighted) but I couldn’t find a way on the PC, using my default PDF reader- Acrobat Reader DC. It seems that most of the useful functionality requires the pro version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first tried to edit it in GIMP (opensource photo editing software). I was able to import each of the PDF pages as layers and delete the layers I didn’t need. However, I couldn’t find a way of exporting properly, all I got was the first page. I did see something about saving it as a .mng and using inkscape/imagemagick’s ‘convert’ command but it seemed like a bit of work. Next up, LibreOffice, I saw an article describing that it was possible to import and edit a PDF using this software. This worked well, and was very intuitive, however when I looked at the exported PDF document it had made all the pages portrait. This was a problem as my some of my pages with wide tables were landscape, so it had clipped them. Not being able to find a way to rotate individual pages in LibreOffice (there must be a way of doing this!), I tried a final option to use the Google Drive extension - DocHub. This worked so well and made it really easy to save the edited pdf back to my Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you need some powerful software to edit a PDF quickly, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://dochub.com&#34;&gt;DocHub&lt;/a&gt;! Just beware that it’s only free up to a point. You can view and edit up to 2,000 documents, sign 5 documents/month, request up to 3 signers/month and email up to 3 documents/day, anything over this and you will need to go onto the pro account.&lt;/p&gt;
