      <description>The aim was to understand more about the optional courses available for MSc students in the school of Geosciences. This meant building a dataframe that contained the interesting bits of information available on the University of Edinburgh website so that I could query it to find out answers to questions such as: How many 10 credit courses are available? Which degree cluster do the courses belong to and is there any overlap?</description>

      <title>Removing pages from a PDF</title>

      <description>More of a note than a post but hopefully this can help someone else out having the same issue.
I needed to remove a couple of pages from a PDF document today. This can be done easily on a mac using preview (i.e. backspace when the page thumbnail is highlighted) but I couldn’t find a way on the PC, using my default PDF reader- Acrobat Reader DC. It seems that most of the useful functionality requires the pro version.</description>
