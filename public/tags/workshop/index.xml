      <description>Background I am keen to employ technology to assist in teaching. I went to the Social Science and Medicine Annual Scientific meeting in Glasgow, last September and noticed that they were using software to get responses from the audience. The software was called Mentimeter and I planned to use it in future teaching and outreach. It turns out there has been a paper published from researchers from the University of Glasgow on the merits of interactive polling for teaching, see here.</description>
