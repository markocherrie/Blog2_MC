      <description>The aim was to understand more about the optional courses available for MSc students in the school of Geosciences. This meant building a dataframe that contained the interesting bits of information available on the University of Edinburgh website so that I could query it to find out answers to questions such as: How many 10 credit courses are available? Which degree cluster do the courses belong to and is there any overlap?</description>
