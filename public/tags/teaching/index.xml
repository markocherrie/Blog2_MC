      <description>Background I am keen to employ technology to assist in teaching. I went to the Social Science and Medicine Annual Scientific meeting in Glasgow last September and noticed that they were using software to get responses from the audience. The software was called Mentimeter. It turns out there has been a paper published by researchers from the University of Glasgow on the merits of interactive polling for teaching. The authors summarise that experiences of this technology are generally positive but caution that future use should focus first on the pedagogical approach.</description>
