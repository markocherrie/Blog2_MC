      <title>Removing pages from a PDF</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More of a note than a post but hopefully this can help someone else out having the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to remove a couple of pages from a PDF document today. This can be done easily on a mac using preview (i.e. backspace when the page thumbnail is highlighted) but I couldn’t find a way on the PC, using my default PDF reader- Acrobat Reader DC. It seems that most of the useful functionality requires the pro version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first tried to edit it in GIMP (opensource photo editing software). I was able to import each of the PDF pages as layers and delete the layers I didn’t need. However, I couldn’t find a way of exporting properly, all I got was the first page. I did see something about saving it as a .mng and using inkscape/imagemagick’s ‘convert’ command but it seemed like a bit of work. Next up, LibreOffice, I saw an article describing that it was possible to import and edit a PDF using this software. This worked well, and was very intuitive, however when I looked at the exported PDF document it had made all the pages portrait. This was a problem as my some of my pages with wide table were landscape, so it had clipped them. Not being able to find a way to rotate individual pages in libreOffice (there must be a way of doing this!), I tried a final option to use a google drive extension- DocHub. This worked so well and made it really easy to save back to my Google drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you need some powerful software to edit a PDF quickly, check out [DocHub] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dochub.com&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://dochub.com&lt;/a&gt;)! Just beware that it’s only free up to a point. You can view and edit up to 2,000 documents, sign 5 documents/month, request up to 3 signers/month and email up to 3 documents/day, anything over this and you will need to go onto the pro account.&lt;/p&gt;
