      <description>Background The health benefit of greater availability of greenspaces is mediated by the quality of spaces Zhang et al., 2017.

Another method to determine quality is from GIS derived measures of land use. Perhaps the optimal method is using questionnaire self-report and GIS-derived measures as has been developed by Stessens et al.</description>
