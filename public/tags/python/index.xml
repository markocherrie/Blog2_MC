      <description>Introduction The built environment is constantly changing. Whether it be short term changes - e.g. roadworks, or long term, e.g. a new road. These changes can impact our exposures (air pollutants from road traffic), behaviours (decision to drive to work) or health (risk of being in a traffic accident). It’s thereofore important to monitor the changes to the built environment.
One way is using remote sensing. Satellites can be equipped with instruments that collect information on reflected light, which can be used to infer changes in vegetation.</description>
