      <description>Background Are you collecting lots of geospatial data and need a way to quickly visualise what you’ve got? Read on! I had this problem; I was collecting a lot of information on my daily movements from Arc App: Location and Activity (more on the use of Arc for research later). Additionally, I wanted to quickly see what features of the urban environment (e.g. greenspaces) I was being ‘exposed’ to. The solution was Uber’s open source geospatial analysis tool: Kepler.</description>

      <description>Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have had devolved powers since 1997, 1997 and 1998 respectively. During this time 480 Acts have been passed, an act being defined as primary legislation which has been through several stages from:
Pre-legislative scrutiny on the draft piece of legislation (bill)First Reading - first presentation, no votingSecond Reading - debate on principles, votingCommittee Stage - Considers bill clausesConsideration or report stage - Consider further amendmentsThird Reading - Consider final textPassage - Sent to other house (i.</description>

      <title>Nudging people to make healthy behaviour choices</title>

      <description>Nudge theory made it big after the 2008 book by Thaler and Sunstein gathered some high profile readers (Obama, Cameron etc). Alongside public health officials and politicians, researchers have been interested in using the theory to influence people to make ‘healthy’ behaviour choices. The central tenant of the theory is based around libertarian paternalism, or influencing an individual’s ‘choice architecture’ without coercion. Nudge-type interventions (e.g. nutritional labeling, size of serving dishes) have been used to tackle obesity and were found to increase ‘healthy’ behaviours by 15.</description>

      <description>Background The health benefit of greater availability of greenspaces is mediated by the quality of these spaces (Zhang et al., 2017). Recently, quality was associated with psychological distress, whereas availability had no effect (Feng and Astell-Burt, 2018). Both of these measures of quality were self-reported. Another method to determine quality is from GIS-derived measures of land use. Perhaps the optimal method is using questionnaire self-report and GIS-derived measures as has been developed by (Stessens et al.</description>

      <description>I have just come across Mapzen’s routing engine (Valhalla), which can be used to produce incredible isochrone maps, mentioned in this blog post. If you’ve not heard of Mapzen they provide mapping tools for developers so that their websites can be converted to the spatial side. The neat thing about isochrone lines is that they show the boundary around a point where travel time is equal. So you can ask some interesting proximity based questions (e.</description>
