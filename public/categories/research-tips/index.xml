      <description>Welcome to my first post. As an avid R user, I was amazed at how quickly it was to setup a static website with the help from the R package: “blogdown”. I thought Yihui Xie gave a convincing argument for blogging from his personal experience (Appendix D in above website). In summary he provides three reasons in favour of blogging:
To consolidate thoughts and create a clearer argument for topics that are important to you.</description>
